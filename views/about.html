<div class="container"> <div class="col-lg-12 about"> I started dabbling in design in a real way at a very young age, utilizing the Quake 3 engine to create dynamic 3d backdrops for my schoolâ€™s fall and winter theatre productions. This experience introduced me to advanced graphic tecqniques and ignighted the spark still burning bright in my heart. Since then I have worked with clients ranging from Fortune 500 companies to non-profits helping deliver web experiences from concept to completion to thier clients and internal users. </div> </div>
